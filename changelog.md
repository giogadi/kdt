# 0.2.3
* For internal priority queue implementation, use the heap library instead of pqueue library in order to build on ghc 7.10.

# 0.2.2
* Relax lower version bound on QuickCheck to 2.5.

# 0.2.1
* Relax upper version constraint for MonadRandom (benchmarking code)
* Add Data.Point2d as dependency of executables so tests and benchmarks can be built from the archive downloaded on Hackage.

# 0.2.0
* Lots and lots of renaming all throughout to more closely match terminology used in `containers`.
* Removed kdt library dependency on QuickCheck (if not building testing code).
* Removed testing module Point2d from public API
* All structures now have Show instance
* Static variants now have functions for dynamically inserting new points into existing structure, with caveat that these functions do not maintain balanced tree structure.
